          Peter Merriman has once again outdone himself. In addition to a
          fabulous menu, his Kapalua restaurant is stunningly gorgeous, with the
          fantastic patio that sits right above the ocean at Kapalua Beach.
          Merriman’s historical use of locally sourced fresh produce and
          ingredients (90%) has earned him the well-deserved accolades for all
          of his locations.
